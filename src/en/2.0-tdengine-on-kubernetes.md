# Setup TDengine Cluster on Kubernetes

In this chapter, we hope to introduce how to use YAML files to create a TDengine cluster from scratch step by step in the first subsection, and focus on the common operations of TDengine in the Kubernetes environment. You can learn about the deployment mechanism of TDengine in the Kubernetes cluster. The second section introduces how to use Helm to deploy TDengine. It is recommended to use the Helm Chart deployment method in the production environment. We will continue to update the TDengine Chart, so stay tuned.
